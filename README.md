Unfortunately the folium maps do not seem to render on GitHub natively. It has something to do with the site's settings on running JavaScript. However, to get proper visualization of maps included in a notebook drop the particular notebook's github link into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and get a full dynamic output. Thanks!
